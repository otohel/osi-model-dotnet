## 📚 How It Works
Once the application is running, you will see a user-friendly interface. You can interact with the client and server console applications. The application will guide you through each layer of the OSI model. You will observe how data changes as it moves through the network layers.

### 🌐 Features
- **Client-Server Communication:** Understand how data is sent and received.
- **Visualizations:** See clear representations of data transformation.
- **Educational Guidance:** Follow simple prompts to learn each part of the OSI model.

## 🧐 Learning About the OSI Model
The OSI model has seven layers:
1. **Application Layer:** Where user applications operate.
2. **Presentation Layer:** Translates data formats.
3. **Session Layer:** Manages sessions between applications.
4. **Transport Layer:** Ensures reliable data transfer.
5. **Network Layer:** Handles routing and addressing.
6. **Data Link Layer:** Manages node-to-node data transfer.
7. **Physical Layer:** Transmits raw data over a physical medium.

By using this application, you can explore each layer in detail.

## 📊 Visual Demonstration
As you operate the application, you will see diagrams representing how data travels through each layer. This visual approach helps clarify complex concepts in networking.
